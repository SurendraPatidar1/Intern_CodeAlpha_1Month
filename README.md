1. IMAGE GALLERY --
-- Create an image gallery where users can view a
collection of images. Use HTML/CSS for layout
and JavaScript for image navigation and any
interactive features.

Logic::
========== HTML:
Creates the basic structure of the gallery with a container for the image and buttons to navigate through the images.
========== CSS:
Styles the gallery layout, including the image, buttons, and background.
========== JavaScript:
Manages the image navigation functionality. It stores an array of image paths and allows users to move forward and backward through the gallery.
